J-PBR is intended for use with Compliance 32x and any shaderpack which supports the old PBR standard set by classic SEUS. I personally recommend Complementary Shaders for use with this pack. J-PBR is not intended for use with custom 3D models, but can probably work with simple 3D addons if you disable Parallax Occlusion Mapping.

Keep in mind that I'm 100% self taught through trial and error and looking at other packs. This is the first pack I have ever released to the public, and I'm still learning the technical standards and best practices.

I do understand that labPBR is overall a more robust and complete standard than SEUS' format, but I'm still in the process of teaching myself how to use it, and my preferred shaderpack doesn't support its most interesting unique features anyway. I may recreate this addon using the full potential of labPBR at some point in the future, but I believe what's here works well enough to release. 

There is quite a bit of overlap between the old-school SEUS standard and the labPBR standard, so this pack may look presentable even using a shader that only supports labPBR. However, you may see some strange artifacts depending on the implementation of the standard and what aspects of it are enabled in the shader settings.
